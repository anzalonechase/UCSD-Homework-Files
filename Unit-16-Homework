## Week 16 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is: Google result is karl Fitzgerald as CEO Altoro Mutual

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker:
 The people the come up as a google result of that company could then be further targetted and a malicious individual can see if they can somehow compromise the workers to gain information on the company


#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: San Antonio Texas 

  2. What is the NetRange IP address: 65.61.137.64-65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure: Rackspace Backbone Engineering

  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server: 65.61.137.117

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find: 80, 443, 8080

#### Step 4: Recon-ng

- Install the Recon module `xssed`. start up recon-ng by simply typing "recon-ng" then "marketplace install xssed"
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`. "module load recon/domains-vulnerabilities/xssed"
, then "options set SOURCE demo.testfire.net"
- Run the module. "run"

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: yes, results show one posible vulnerabilitiy

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: nmap -sV 192.168.0.10
but in this case used "intense scan" 
command executed is "nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.10" inside zenmap 
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.10 > zenmapscan.txt

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: navigate to usr/share/nmap/scripts
then run "nmap -sV 192.168.0.10 --script smb-enum-shares.nse -v"


- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability: firstly the fact that we are even able to run scripts against the service.
  secondly, the information revealed, shows file paths to certain things, and some permissions that are listed,
  we also see that there are read/write capabilities for anonymous users

  2. Why is it dangerous: for the printers that are available for example, you could possibly edit a file remotely witht he service being up and vulnerable that you could inject some lines of code to make a backdoor.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server: not leaving these services constantly open when not in use, make them protected from scans to certain extents USING PORT KNOCKING/HONEYPOTS
